<h2> 🚀 Image Caption Generator with CNN and LSTM  </h2>

<p> 🔘 This Python-based project aims to build an image caption generator by implementing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. The CNN extracts image features from the Xception model, while the LSTM generates image captions.</p>
